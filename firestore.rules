    /**
     * Core Philosophy:
     * This ruleset enforces a security model centered on user roles and data ownership,
     * designed for the FortressGate visitor management system. The primary goal is to
     * ensure that users can only access data relevant to their function (e.g., personnel
     * managing their visits, admins managing system data) while maintaining strict
     * separation of private user information.
     *
     * Data Structure:
     * The structure separates system-wide configuration (like /roles, /facilities) from
     * user-specific data (/users/{userId}), operational data (/personnel, /visitors),
     * and sensitive logs (/auditLogs). A key pattern is the dual representation of visits
     * under both /personnel/{personnelId}/visits and /visitors/{visitorId}/visits. This
     * structural segregation supports efficient and secure queries based on the access context.
     *
     * Key Security Decisions:
     * - User Data: All data under /users/{userId} is strictly private and accessible only
     *   to the authenticated owner of that data tree.
     * - Administrative Data: Collections like /roles, /facilities, /devices, and /blacklists
     *   are treated as read-only for authenticated users. Writes to these collections should
     *   be performed by a trusted backend service or a future-defined admin role.
     * - Personnel & Visits: A 'Personnel' document is owned by the associated 'User' (via the `userId` field).
     *   This ownership extends to their subcollection of 'visits'. This allows personnel
     *   to manage visits where they are the host.
     * - Audit Logs: The /auditLogs collection is immutable from client applications to ensure
     *   the integrity of system records. All writes must originate from the backend.
     *
     * Denormalization for Authorization:
     * To ensure fast and secure rule evaluation, this ruleset relies on denormalized
     * ownership fields. For example, the `/personnel/{personnelId}` document must contain a
     * `userId` field. This avoids slow and costly `get()` calls to other collections during
     * an authorization check.
     *
     * Structural Segregation:
     * The separation of a user's private data (e.g., `/users/{userId}/notifications`) into
     * a dedicated subcollection is a core principle. This is more secure and performant
     * for list operations than mixing public and private data in a single collection.
